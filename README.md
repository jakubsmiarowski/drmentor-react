## Project Overview

Frontend app I build for my dad's new business idea

## Technical Details

1. ReactJS
2. React Hooks
3. Internationalizaiton with i18n library
4. Typed.js

## Personal Growth

This one is rather special. Much as myself, my dad has also been turning his career life 180 degrees and trying to work on new things. And for marketing reasons he needed the website to show his potential clients. This is the second version of this website, the one I like better. This was really good experience how it would be working with a client. I know its not the same but doing all the strange requests and wishes from my dad sure felt like so. I'm really happy how things evolved with this one.
